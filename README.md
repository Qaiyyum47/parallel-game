# Bubble Parallel

**Bubble Parallel** is a physics-based platformer where you control a bubble through challenging environments. Your goal is to navigate perilous obstacles and enemies while using your bubble’s air to propel yourself. Be careful, though—if your bubble gets too small, it'll pop!  

This game was created during **Global Game Jam Malaysia 2025**, and it’s one of the first games made by a team of four. This was our **first game jam** experience, and we’ve learned a lot through it. We hope you enjoy our creation!
